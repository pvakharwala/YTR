# YTR
This is the front end developed by me. This is showcased in my LinkedIn profile. All the build files and source code are in The zip file.
This project uses Dapper and uses a sql server running in docker container.
You will also require two cards with modbus implemented on them.
You can use dummy data to be represented but since the software very tailor made you will run into some known issues if ranmdom numbers are used for representing data.
